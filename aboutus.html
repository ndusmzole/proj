        <div class="hiw"><h3>About Us</h3><p>After careful study and research, we have seen that 80% of people fail to a service their cars on time, because they must reschedule everything just to get the car to the workshop. Which leads us to design the company which will be almost close to 100% convenient to our clients. The company is designed for those who don’t want to miss their meetings because they must take a car to the maintenance. 

    We are based on Umlazi and surrounding areas (click to see areas), we provide major and minor service based on site. We come to you were ever you are.

    <h1>What are benefits of maintaining your vehicle?</h1>
    <div class="parent_hiw">
       
        <div class="hiw"><h3>Longevity</h3><p>One of the most important benefits of good car maintenance is that you give it a longer life span.

    Ideally, maintaining your car won’t require as much on its parts you should regularly check the fluids levels, brakes and battery. Those are the things which keeps your car running smoothly.
    </p></div>
    </div><br/>

    <div class="parent_hiw">
       
        <div class="hiw"><h3>Safety</h3><p>An un-regular serviced car can be dangerous to you and everyone on the road. For instance, regular servicing your car helps identifying problems in your car on your suspension, condition of your car Tyres the pressures on your tyres and replace what is needed to be replaced that can save you from flat tire or a blowout.
    </p></div>
    </div><br/>
    <div class="parent_hiw">
       
        <div class="hiw"><h3>Can Save You A Lot of Money</h3><p>The engine can’t function alone it needs most of the parts which works with it such air filters, oil filters spark plugs, etc. Some of this part are not 5 years Guaranteed like an Engine.<br>

        Your engine can’t function 5 Years without being regular serviced as manufactures requirement. By failing to do a proper maintenance Air filters may allow dust to your engine   which will leads your engine to stall - which is both costly and inconvenient if you subsequently become reliant on hire cars or public transport whilst your vehicle is fixed.<br>


        Regular servicing your car, new oil air filters results in a more smoother running engine and a more smoother running engine and a more fuel efficiency in a car and also increase performance of the car dramatically.
